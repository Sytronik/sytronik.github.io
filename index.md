## Papers

### Conference Papers

- Jeongmin Liu, Byeongho Jo, Jung-Woo Choi, **Dereverberation Based on Deep Neural Networks with Directional Feature from Spherical Microphone Array Recordings**, in Proc. of the 23rd International Congress on Acoustics (ICA 2019), Aachen, Germany, September 9-13, 2019. 
    
  In the paper, the authors propose a method that uses spatially-averaged acoustic intensity vector as an input feature of the DNN  in order to make the DNN perform speech dereverberation by considering spatial information.
