## Papers

### Conference Papers

- Jeongmin Liu, Byeongho Jo, Jung-Woo Choi, **Dereverberation Based on Deep Neural Networks with Directional Feature from Spherical Microphone Array Recordings**, in Proc. of the 23rd International Congress on Acoustics (ICA 2019), Aachen, Germany, September 9-13, 2019. 
    
  In the paper, the authors propose a method that uses spatially-averaged acoustic intensity vector as an input feature of the DNN  in order to make the DNN perform speech dereverberation by considering spatial information.

## Projects

- **Thesia: Multi-track Spectrogram / Waveform Viewer**  
  *November 2020 - Present*  
  An open-source project. Electron app w/ Rust & WebAssembly.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Sytronik/thesia)

- **Music Boundary Detection using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks**  
  *May - July 2019*  
  For the team projects in the lecture "Musical Applications of Machine Learning", My team made the DNN model that detects boundaries between musical sections, which have different musical themes. I contributed to the DNN model structure and training techniques, and I implemented them.

- **VR Drum**  
  *2017*  
  For the graduation project, my team created an application that lets people can play the drums in virtual reality. I was the main programmer in the project.

- **Extracting Musical Rhythms from Repetitive Videos**  
  *March - May 2017*  
  For the project in the lecture "Digital Image Processing", I created a simple algorithm as the first step to choose music that rhythmically matched to the repetitive videos. The algorithm extracts a rough temporal regularity from repetitive videos, approximates the regularity to a typical 4/4 rhythm, and inserts a simple rhythm instrument pattern.
